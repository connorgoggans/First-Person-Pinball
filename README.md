# Pinball Wizard

# Overview
A friend and I built Pinball Wizard as our entry to VandyHacks Fall 2015.  This was our first attempt at game creation and the 
Unity3D engine.  We were selected as finalists and we won sponsor awards from Digital Reasoning and Launch Tennessee for Pinball Wizard.

#What it does
The program simulates a normal game of pinball, where the player uses two flippers to keep the ball in play.
However, there is also the option to view the game from a first-person perspective, wherein a person wearing an 
Oculus Rift can see the game from the point-of-view of the pinball. They can also control the speed of time as well 
as the spin of the ball with a Myo armband in order to nudge the ball away from (or towards) hazards.

#How we built it
The game was built using the Unity3D engine in conjunction with C# scripts and the Myo and Oculus Unity engine scripts. 
In addition, we used blender to create models for game objects.
